    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started off today with a specific goal in mind. By the end of the day, I was pretty off my mark.</p>

<p>My original intent was to work through a tutorial, <a href="http://www.grabmueller.de/martin/www/pub/AlgorithmW.pdf">Algorithm W Step by Step</a>, for implementing the classic Algorithm W (proposed by Robin Milner) for type inference in Haskell. I was stoked to finally take a closer look at Hindley-Milner and foolishly thought I would spend a few days on it.</p>

<p>In reality, I had started my descent down the rabbit hole. I found myself reading, and while I felt comfortable with the actual Haskell code itself, the reasons for why the tutorial was implementing things by using sets, or talking about free type variables and type schemes made me feel that yeah, maybe(?) I could infer knowledge from my understanding of Haskell, but I was still lacking appropriate knowledge for this literature.</p>

<p>So, I asked this silly question on Zulip:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Stream</strong>: Category Theory/Type Theory/Set Theory</p>

<p><strong>Message</strong>: Hi hi. I&rsquo;m delving into Hindley-Milner for type inference and I&rsquo;m finding lots of terminology that I don&rsquo;t understand. Are there any friendly introductions to all of the theories? AM I WAY IN OVER MY HEAD?</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.rntz.net/">Rntz</a> pointed me to <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/">Types and Programming Languages</a> as a resource and I was intrigued. I started reading it, and of course my attention started to wane because textbooks. After some googling, and remember back to my first week at Hacker School, I was reminded of a UPenn grad course called <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/current/index.html">Software Foundations</a>. The course uses TAPL but also utilizes an interactive book of Coq proofs as its main text. Interactive? Sign me up.</p>

<p>Two ways to run Coq are through the CoqIDE or through Proof General Coq mode in Emacs. I found to my chagrin that CoqIDE was ugly and slow and in general, not something that I wanted to use. But that meant that I had to learn&hellip; Emacs. So for about two hours, I went through the Emacs tutorial and fiddled with my .emacs file, thinking about the time I saw Richard Stallman dressed as a saint from the Church of Emacs and resigned myself to learning a new text editor/operating system/whatever (plz don&rsquo;t hurt me, I&rsquo;m new to emacs).</p>

<p>After this, I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to return Coq through Proof General, and time passed while I grew increasingly frustrated. Then Alan to the rescue! He helped me figure out that emacs wasn&rsquo;t correctly loading my path, and once that was fixed, I was able to write Coq and do cute stuff like:</p>

<p><code>coq
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.
</code></p>

<p>Yay!</p>

<p>Tomorrow I will continue working through Software Foundations. Aki, an alum, has also kindly pointed me to some resources for implementing type inference algorithms which I plan to hit up once I have gotten a feel for the theory behind it. Excited to see where this leads.</p>

<p>Oh, and I remapped <code>Caps Lock</code> from <code>ESC</code> to <code>CTRL</code>. So, uh, yeah.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday was a super productive day for me. In the morning, I was in the midst of debugging my gunzip implementation in Haskell.
I have a function <code>addItem</code> that adds a node to a HuffmanTree by writing an IORef val because I needed mutability. When I&rsquo;m creating the HuffmanTree, I need to add a whole slew of values (from a code table) into the tree, so I mapped the addItem function over the list of codes, which returned <code>[IO()]</code>. My problem here was that despite having added items to an initial empty tree, I was returning an unaltered tree. I was confused because I was sure I had allowed for mutability! But why?!</p>

<p>Luckily, Alan happened to be running an impromptu session on Monads where he covered the IO Monad, and attending that helped me figure out what my problem was, I think.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still not precisely sure if I&rsquo;m understanding correctly but <code>[IO()]</code> is a list of <code>IO()</code>s. And things in the IO monad won&rsquo;t evaluate until run-time. So basically I had a list of thunk-like things that wouldn&rsquo;t write until evaluated.</p>

<p>This does not work
<code>haskell
let added =  map (\(label, codes) -&gt; addItem root label codes) code_table
</code></p>

<p>but this works
<code>haskell
added &lt;- sequence $ map (\(label, codes) -&gt; addItem root label codes) (code_table)
</code></p>

<p>As an aside, <code>added</code> is actually a useless value (it&rsquo;s just a list of <code>()</code>s). I don&rsquo;t care about it. All I care about is the value of <code>root</code> because I have mutated it to add nodes to it.</p>

<p>After this, I spent some time fixing off by one errors because I was translating Julia code to Haskell and Julia is 1-indexed while Haskell is 0-index. Lol. THEN IT WORKED. HUZZAH!</p>

<p>In the afternoon into the evening, I worked with Dana, Minnie, and Sophia on soldering chips, wires, and LEDs together. It was loads of fun and will continue today, I suspect.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow, wow, wow. This week marked the halfway point of my time at Hacker School. It&rsquo;s been an exciting time, with the incoming of the new batch (28 new Hacker Schoolers!) and 455 Broadway is much more lively than it was before. It&rsquo;s been harder to find a place to sit, which is a good problem to have. :)</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t blogged since last week, so a lot has happened since then:</p>

<ul>
<li>Very proud to say that I made the <code>cats</code> stream on Zulip.</li>
<li>My implementation of gunzip is undergoing debugging, so hopefully I can have that done by the end of the week.</li>
<li>Dana taught me how to solder! I soldered wires onto a strip of NeoPixels.</li>
<li>Dana and I checked out <a href="https://hackmanhattan.com/">HackManhattan</a>, a space for hardware hackers. They were kind enough to let us go through their extra parts and we found the power sources we were looking for for the party on Friday.</li>
<li>Mel Chua, our first resident, gave us very informative talks on different learning styles and how to maximize our time at Hacker School. I do sort of wish this happend on the first week for &ldquo;seconds&rdquo; since I feel like some of us floundered at figuring out how to get used to self-directedness.</li>
<li>I missed my first Friday session to go visit my mom in North Carolina.</li>
<li>I am back to being addicted to coffee. <a href="http://www.portorico.com/store/">Porto Rico Importing Co.</a> is my vice.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&rsquo;s to another six weeks! Well, more like 5 and a half weeks. :D:D:D:D:D:D: &lt;&mdash; Some alums taught me this happy/sad combo face.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.dariajung.com/blog/2014/07/15/gunzip/"/>

    <id>http://blog.dariajung.com/blog/2014/07/15/gunzip</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For a couple of days, I told myself that I would study OCaml now that I have a decent grasp of Haskell. But it&rsquo;s actually been pretty
difficult to leave Haskell because I am rather enamoured with the language. &#10084;</p>

<p>I did however, manage to read through a good chunk of <a href="http://ocaml-book.com/">OCaml from the Very Beginning</a>, and work through the exercises that accompany each chapter. I found it to be a very solid introductory text, as the author makes no assumptions about the reader&rsquo;s background. I plan to finish it up at some point, and move on to <em>Real World OCaml</em>.</p>

<p>A couple of things that jumped out at me as I started learning OCaml:</p>

<ul>
<li>The standard library is pretty sparse. Will be checking out Jane Street&rsquo;s Core.</li>
<li>There are mutable data structures.</li>
<li>OCaml supports imperative and functional styles.</li>
<li>The introductory text, at least <em>OCaml from the Very Beginning</em>, emphasized understanding tail recursion (which I didn&rsquo;t really think about when learning Haskell, but maybe I did it wrong)</li>
<li>Utop is pretty cool.</li>
<li>I got confused by <code>=</code> and <code>==</code> because I wanted to use <code>==</code> but that seems to be reserved for people who really know what they&rsquo;re doing.</li>
</ul>


<p>For the past few days, I have been exploring file compression and decompression. I needed a new project and starting looking at what previous HSers had done, and I found this <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/10/24/day-16-gzip-plus-poetry-equals-awesome/">blog post</a> by alumna <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk">Julia Evans</a> on implementing gunzip in Julia. So I&rsquo;ve decided to implement it in Haskell! :D :D :D</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading up on the <a href="http://www.gzip.org/algorithm.txt">algorithm specifications</a> for inflating and deflating and the <a href="http://www.gzip.org/format.txt">format</a> information. I tried looking at the source in C but my head started to hurt, so I have been studying Julia&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/jvns/gzip.jl/blob/master/gzip.jl">implementation</a>, which despite me never having seen Julia code before, has been very helpful.</p>

<p>I spent today working on parsing a gzipped file&rsquo;s header and metadata information. Tomorrow I will read up more on the algorithm description and dive into implementing inflate.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Recursion Friday]]></title>
    <link href="http://blog.dariajung.com/blog/2014/07/12/recursion-friday/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday at Hacker School was Recursion Friday. Basically, a group of HSers sat down and worked on various recursive problems and brain teasers in the languages of our choice.</p>

<p>Recursion used to make me go like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.giphy.com/media/NoglyWTK9tCMw/giphy.gif" alt="Scared" /></p>

<p>But somewhere along the way as I was learning Haskell, recursion started to click with my previously recursion-addled brain.</p>

<p>One of the questions yesterday was to find all of the permutations of a string. After some white boarding with Denise and Georgi, talking it through with Alan and Tom, we basically came to the conclusion that the algorithm should be something like this (in pseudocode):</p>

<p>```
Permute(&ldquo;abcd&rdquo;) =</p>

<pre><code>"a" + Permute("bcd") 
&lt;list concatenation&gt; 
"b" + Permute("acd") 
&lt;list concatenation&gt;
"c" + Permute("bcd") 
&lt;list concatenation&gt;
"d" + Permute("abc") 
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>So, generate all of the permutations of the string without one of the elements of the original string, and concat it with all possible permutations of the smaller string, then concat all of those together to get the final list of permutations.</p>

<p>After speaking with Alan about a Haskell implementation, this is what I ended up with</p>

<p>```haskell
import Data.List</p>

<p>permute :: Eq a => [a] &ndash;> [[a]]
permute [] = [[]]
permute xs = [ y | prefix &lt;&ndash; xs, y &lt;&ndash; map (prefix:)</p>

<pre><code>               $ permute $ xs \\ [prefix]]
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>An obnoxiously short list comprehension.</p>

<p>Pull the prefix from the original string, map a list concatenation of the prefix, (prefix:), to the various permutations of the rest of the string. <code>\\</code> is this nifty function in the Data.List library that performs list difference, so it was an easy way to exclude the prefix from the original string (thanks to Alan for showing me that).</p>

<p>```haskell
ghci> permute &ldquo;abcd&rdquo;</p>

<p>[&ldquo;abcd&rdquo;,&ldquo;abdc&rdquo;,&ldquo;acbd&rdquo;,&ldquo;acdb&rdquo;,&ldquo;adbc&rdquo;,&ldquo;adcb&rdquo;,
&ldquo;bacd&rdquo;,&ldquo;badc&rdquo;,&ldquo;bcad&rdquo;,&ldquo;bcda&rdquo;,&ldquo;bdac&rdquo;,&ldquo;bdca&rdquo;,
&ldquo;cabd&rdquo;,&ldquo;cadb&rdquo;,&ldquo;cbad&rdquo;,&ldquo;cbda&rdquo;,&ldquo;cdab&rdquo;,&ldquo;cdba&rdquo;,
&ldquo;dabc&rdquo;,&ldquo;dacb&rdquo;,&ldquo;dbac&rdquo;,&ldquo;dbca&rdquo;,&ldquo;dcab&rdquo;,&ldquo;dcba&rdquo;]
```</p>

<p>Recursion still blows my mind.</p>
