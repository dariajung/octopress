  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few days ago, I stumbled on a <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/category-theory">repository</a> on GitHub that was exploring category theory through the use of Coq, formalizing Edware Kmett&rsquo;s Hask library. Curious, I wondered what Hask was and read the description: &ldquo;Category theory for Haskell with a lens flavor&rdquo;.</p>

<p>But&hellip; what are lenses?</p>

<p>I remembered that I had bookmarked a <a href="http://blog.jakubarnold.cz/2014/07/14/lens-tutorial-introduction-part-1.html">blog post</a> that Steve Klabnik tweeted a while ago because it was related to Haskell. And now it was relevant to my interests.</p>

<p>Lenses are, at a high level, something like &ldquo;getters&rdquo; and &ldquo;setters&rdquo; that are used in imperative programming languages. It&rsquo;s not uncommon to see something like <code>book.author.name</code>. Lenses provide an abstraction like this for Haskell.</p>

<p>I spent a long time staring at the explanations in this blog post, and after pairing with Alan a bit on a simple Lens implementation, felt blown away by the weirdness and how elegant of an idea this was.</p>

<p>A realization that I had about working with Alan (after ten weeks&hellip;) is that he is the type of person to think things out by writing on a white board. Up until this point, I had never really thought about whiteboarding as a way of getting my thoughts out so that I could actually <em>look</em> at them. And the act of writing type signatures out instead of staring at them on a screen made a lot of difference for me. (I do write on scratch paper, but I generally do so very disorganizedly).</p>

<p>After Thursday demo presentations, I spent about thirty minutes whiteboarding out my thought process for the implementations of <code>over</code> and <code>set</code>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/wb2.JPG" alt="whiteboarding 1" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/wb1.JPG" alt="whiteboarding 1" /></p>

<p>I guess moral of the story for me is that I should whiteboard more to figure out what I&rsquo;m doing when I&rsquo;m confused before jumping straight to code. A very simple epiphany, but a very helpful one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently purchased my first Raspberry Pi (the Model B+ whooho!)</p>

<p><img src="/images/pi.jpg" alt="&quot;PI&quot;" /></p>

<p>I decided that my first RaspPi project would be to build a Cat Cam to monitor Kitkat while I am away from the apartment. Occasionally he&rsquo;s being doing a few weird things like pooping outside of his litter box while I&rsquo;m not home. Basically, this is me spying on my cat.</p>

<p>After a couple of component orders (PS3Eye webcam, MicroSD card) arrived, I was ready to start setting up my new Pi.</p>

<p>Dana lent me her serial cable so I could access the Pi without an external display. However, this meant that NOOBS wouldn&rsquo;t work (it seems to require an external display), and we had to mount Raspbian Wheezy onto the SD card. There are always bumps along the way to setting up new hardware&hellip; Soon after this though, I was able to SSH into the Pi, which was great!</p>

<p>But more complications followed&hellip; RaspPi is developed in the UK, so the locale was set to en-GB.UTF8. I had some problems figuring out how to get it to be en-US.UTF8 and was going crazy trying to figure it out, because I SWEAR I was selecting install new locales when I tried to generate and update them. (Lol, no I wasn&rsquo;t). Luckily, <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/residents#Paul-Tagliamonte">Paul</a> was able to help me troubleshoot and not pull my hair out.</p>

<p>Then, I was ready to set up the PS3Eye camera and motion detection snapshots using the motion package and following along with this <a href="http://chris.gg/2012/07/using-a-ps3-eyetoy-with-the-raspberry-pi/">tutorial</a>. The set up with the camera was incredibly straightforward, and things just worked! I was able to view the stream from within the local network of the Pi. But as it turned out, <em>only</em> the local network. When I excitely told Matt to view the stream (after I had pushed a simple Python-Flask app to Heroku), he told me that the stream was empty.</p>

<p>Slightly deflated, I started looking around RaspPi forums and found out that my problem was because the RaspPis, as a default, only allow connections from a local network due to security reasons. Basically all of the suggestions pointed to enabling port forwarding, which seemed like a super insecure move, even for someone who has barely any knowledge of security practices. Basically, I would have to open up the Pi to the outside world so the stream could be viewable on the Internet. This meant that anyone could try to SSH into it; even if it has no sensitive information on it, I still don&rsquo;t want people in my Pi :/.</p>

<p>(I took a break at this point to create a script that emailed my personal email account the IP address of the RaspPi every time it was booted to make it easy to SSH into it. Whoo!)</p>

<p>I wanted to avoid port forwarding if I could. I thought about it a bit, and last night, I remembered the awesome AWESOMENESS that is <a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a>. Ngrok creates a tunnel between localhost and the Internet. This totally solved my problem! So this morning, I played around with ngrok on the Pi, creating a tunnel that would allow the webcam feed to be viewable from the Internet, and used that in the Flask app feed source. To double check that this worked, I asked Matt to view it from Minnesota (he&rsquo;s on vacay visiting family). AND VICTORY, IT WORKS!</p>

<p>My next steps are to create a start script that runs the motion daemon, and a script to auto start ngrok. I have created a cronjob to delete the contents of a tmp file that takes a picture everytime the webcam detects motion (this can mean A LOT of pictures depending on where it is placed). At midnight every night, the script just deletes the day&rsquo;s worth of pictures, assuming that I will be able to look through them for any suspicious Kitkat behavior before the day is up.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really excited to set this up at home and spy on my cat >:D Next, I want to build a toy component so I can play with Kitkat remotely.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Depression is a lying sack of shit asshole.</p>

<hr/>


<br/>


<p>I think most people know that I love my cat, Kitkat, quite a lot. But I don&rsquo;t think most people know <em>why</em>.</p>

<p>I took a break from college last September due to something that was eventually diagnosed as a severe case of Major Depressive Disorder (Single Episode). For some reason, after a perfectly happy summer, I started to experience a deep, unfathomable sadness and sense of self-loathing. I was back on campus for the fall semester of my third year of university, and I couldn&rsquo;t focus. I slept more than I usually did, and I started crying from exhaustion, and sometimes, for no reason. But mostly, it was because of these cyclic thoughts that kept telling me how worthless of a person I was, and seriously, what was the point? Crazy to think about it now but I reacted to this by simply believing that I was feeling burnt out.</p>

<p>I was able to take a year off from school, a leave of absence as they call it. About a month passed with me sleeping in with all the shades drawn. I didn&rsquo;t see light for several days at a time, and had a hard time doing anything without sobbing for hours (literally <em>hours</em>). One time Matt, my boyfriend, found me in the shower fully clothed and I just remember thinking that I had to get clean. Whatever the compulsion, I&rsquo;m still not sure what exactly I was thinking.</p>

<p>Eventually, I realized that I had a problem. I was scaring myself and I was scaring Matt. I started seeing a therapist and was put on a steady dose of anti-depressants. Around this time, I also decided to foster a cat that was about to be euthanized (Animal Care and Control centers in NYC run out of room due to the amount of animals they take in every day, and so they have to euthanize animals to make room for the incoming animals). Kitkat was on the list of cats to be euthanized. Matt and I put in a request to foster a cat, and because I knew black cats had a smaller chance of being saved, I picked Kitkat.</p>

<p>I was still mostly apartment-ridden at this point, and Matt was working during the day, which meant that I had to go to the East Harlem AC&amp;C to pick up Kitkat. It gave me a reason to leave the apartment, when most days I stayed shut in. Kitkat came into my life when I was feeling completely worthless, and the realization that even someone worthless like me could take care of an animal meant that <em>maybe</em> I actually wasn&rsquo;t worthless. Getting food and toys for Kitkat gave me even more reason to leave and re-enter society, at least see sun for 30 minutes a day. Gradually, Kitkat stopped being a shy shelter cat, and has proven himself a funny and cuddly companion. Supporting evidence: his vet said he was &ldquo;funny and charming&rdquo; :). Becoming Kitkat&rsquo;s human has been just as helpful in my convalescence as support from loved ones, yoga, medication, and cognitive therapy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Wednesday evening, a couple of us headed to a talk by Gayle Laakman McDowell, the author of <em>Cracking the Coding Interview</em>.</p>

<p>She gave us some redundant information, but also some great insights that I had never thought about before.</p>

<p>First some things before the ~technical~ aspect of the interivew:</p>

<ul>
<li>Try to keep your resume to one page because most resume readers spend maybe 5 &ndash; 15 seconds looking at it. There are no fast and hard rules for how it should be formatted, but it should be scannable in that amount of time.</li>
<li>Put your outside of school/work projects on your resume! Many candidates don&rsquo;t put their projects on their resume for whatever reason.</li>
<li>Ask your recruiter what to expect from the interview. There is no reason to be afraid to ask about what you might encounter. However, take this with a grain of salt because the recruiter isn&rsquo;t going to be the one interviewing you.</li>
<li>Coming off a bit weird to a recruiter is okay. As long as you aren&rsquo;t being as asshole, don&rsquo;t worry too much.</li>
</ul>


<p>Other pre-interview stuff to know:</p>

<ul>
<li>Struggling during an interview is <em>normal</em>. The whole point is to see how you reason through difficult questions.</li>
<li>How you do is relative to people who are asked the <strong>same</strong> question. (This in particular was something that made so much sense, but was something I had never realized. I always quantified my success by how many questions I got correct.)</li>
<li>Hashtables go a long way.</li>
<li>Know linked lists, arrays, arraylists, binary search trees, merge sort, and quicksort well.</li>
<li>Know Big O like the back of your hand.</li>
<li>Try to recode data structures from scratch.</li>
<li>Write code on paper so you don&rsquo;t freak out when you have to white board and don&rsquo;t have nice things like syntax highlighting.</li>
</ul>


<p>During the interview:</p>

<ul>
<li>LISTEN for the little details. If you&rsquo;re given a list, is it sorted already? Are the elements distinct? Repeat the question back to make sure you understood it.</li>
<li>Work through the question using a <em>good</em> example.</li>
</ul>


<p>But what is a good example? Let&rsquo;s work with this question Gayle gave us:</p>

<blockquote><p>Given two sorted arrays, compute the intersection.</p></blockquote>

<p>What about:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">15</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is bad because this is a special case, in several ways. The two arrays are the same length, and the element that appears in both arrays are in the same index. These are also too small.</p>

<p>In general, try to come up with examples that avoid special cases, and are about 50% larger than your initial instinct. So if you think about three element arrays, try working with six element arrays.</p>

<p>Brute force a solution first; you can optimize it later but it&rsquo;s better to have a solution to work with. Walk through the brute force solution using your example. Remember the small details when implementing your algorithm, ie: is the input sorted? is the information cached? etc.</p>

<p>The brute force approach to solving this is go through the elements of the first array, and check all elements of the second array to see if they match. Move onto the next element in the first array and do the same thing. Keep doing this until you&rsquo;ve gone through the entire first array.</p>

<p>After this, try to imagine what the fastest you can imagine an algorithm being for the problem you have been given. She called this the best conceivable runtime. Was your solution O(nlogn)? Can you see it being solved in linear time? Try to get there.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to the example question and see how we can optimize it.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">15</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">31</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">33</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">34</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You will have to go through every element in the first array, but not for the second. Why? Well, we know these arrays are sorted. So if we&rsquo;re looking to see if 1 is in both arrays, we look at 1 in the first, but we hit a 2 in the second. Since these are sorted, anything after 2 is going to be greater than 2. We can stop looking here.</p>

<p>Think about spacetime trade offs. Also always keep in mind hashtables because apparently they can be used to solve a lot of algorithms questions in optimal ways. This particular problem can be solved using a hashtable. I have solved it in Python <a href="https://github.com/dariajung/interview-prep/blob/master/data_structures_algos/arrayintersect.py">here</a>.</p>

<p>Some whiteboarding tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>Code far top left corner.</li>
<li>Write small and straight.</li>
<li><em>If</em> it helps, write pseudocode. But don&rsquo;t write psuedocode that uses syntax that looks too much like a programming language&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;ll just look like shitty code.</li>
</ul>


<p>Code breadth first:</p>

<ul>
<li>Modularize from the very beginning.</li>
<li>Go level by level, top down.</li>
<li>Hit the most interesting thing first, then move down.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re most likely to screw up on something like shifting bits around, but that isn&rsquo;t very interesting, so just save it for last.
Interviewers will not care if you messed up on something like that if you got the bigger picture correct.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you&rsquo;re ever confused, stop, and recoup. Don&rsquo;t push through when confused. Walk through your example again.</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re done writing your algorithm, test your code with an example, but NOT the example you used to understand the question. Good examples are long but not necessarily good test cases. Go with something shorter so if you hit a bug, you&rsquo;ll hit the bug faster. Start with small general test cases, then go to special cases.</p>

<p>Look at your code for interesting lines; what lines are most probable for errors?</p>

<p>After this, follow up with your recruiter!</p>

<p>Also, always keep in mind that interviewers are people too, and they all have varying personalities. If one is being really quiet, that doesn&rsquo;t mean you aren&rsquo;t doing well. Sometimes interviewers act harsher if you are doing well! What. They don&rsquo;t think you need their help and they&rsquo;re thinking about ways to push you.</p>

<p>Cool. Once you get an offer, negotiate, because it&rsquo;s a win-win. 30 minutes isn&rsquo;t a lot, but hey, you might get a couple thousand dollars out of it. Counter offer their offer by bumping it up $20k. They&rsquo;ll probably throw you a bone and meet you in the middle.</p>

<p>Obviously Gayle&rsquo;s advice should also be taken with a grain of salt.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The last time I was doing a lot of inductive proofs was during my third year of high school. I did a few in my Discrete Mathematics class, but to be quite honest, I hardly remember anything from that it (I should really revisit the material at some point&hellip;).</p>

<p>Considering that it has been more than four years &mdash;I took a gap year between my second and third year of university, I am now going into third year&mdash; I was a bit unsure of my math chops. But working through <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/current/index.html">Software Foundations</a> has been an absolute blast. And it&rsquo;s been so cool to see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence">Curry-Howard correspondence</a> in action through writing proofs in Coq.</p>

<p>Rntz gave a great presentation on <a href="https://github.com/rntz/curry-howard-slides/raw/master/pres.pdf">Curry-Howard</a>, presenting formal logic, a lambda-calculus, and then showing the connection between formal logic proofs and typed expressions/programs.</p>

<p>So far, I&rsquo;ve been spending time proving some mathematical axioms such as the additive identity, multiplicative communtativity, right distributive property of multiplication over addition of numbers, and so on.</p>

<p>Coq has various proof tactics, <code>intros</code>, <code>destruct</code>, and <code>induction</code>, to name a few.</p>

<p>To show you the kind of stuff I&rsquo;ve been doing, let&rsquo;s work through an example.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s prove that <code>n + 0 = 0</code>.</p>

<p>First we define the theorem (adding a 0 to the right side of a natural number gives us the original natural number):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='coq'><span class='line'><span class="kn">Theorem</span> <span class="n">plus_0_r</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">forall</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">nat</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">.</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So how do we prove this?</p>

<p>Well, first we need to introduce n into the scope of the proof.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='coq'><span class='line'><span class="kn">Proof</span><span class="o">.</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">intros</span><span class="o">.</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Coq shows us that we can now work with n, and that our subgoal is to prove that n + 0 = n.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='coq'><span class='line'><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="n">subgoals</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">subgoal</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">ID</span> <span class="mi">88</span><span class="o">)</span>

<p>Cool. And now we can induct on n. In induction, you must prove the base case of <code>n = 0</code>, and for <code>n = S n'</code>; <code>S n'</code> can be read as the <em>successor</em> of n&#8217;, which is equivalent to n.</p>

<p>So now, we use the <code>induction</code> tactic in Coq:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now we have two subgoals to prove, the base case and the successor case:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>For my own benefit, I like to write out what case I am proving, which in this case is for when <code>n = 0</code>.
As we see, Coq gives us <code>0 + 0 = 0</code>. We can simplify this expression by writing <code>simpl</code>, and Coq will reduce this to <code>0 = 0</code>. And we know <code>0 = 0</code>. It&rsquo;s a fact. We can simply write <code>reflexivity</code> to finish proving this subgoal.</p>

<p>As a sidenote, reflexivity will simplify for you, so it wasn&rsquo;t necessary to do the <code>simpl</code> step. However, I found it helps my thought process to write out all of the steps.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Coq now tells us we have one subgoal remaining:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As you can see, we are given <code>IHn'</code>, an induction hypothesis to work with. So let&rsquo;s prove our second subgoal for case &ldquo;n = S n&#8217;&rdquo;:</p>

<p>We can simplify this down to <code>S (n' + 0) = S n</code> by using the <code>simpl</code> tactic. Adding a 0 to n&#8217;, and then calling a successor on it is no different from adding 0 to the successor of n&#8217;.</p>

<p>But what&rsquo;s this? We have an induction hypothesis that tells us that <code>n' + 0 = n'</code>. Oh, this looks familiar. So let&rsquo;s rewrite <code>S (n' + 0)</code> using our induction hypothesis:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I started off today with a specific goal in mind. By the end of the day, I was pretty off my mark.</p>

<p>My original intent was to work through a tutorial, <a href="http://www.grabmueller.de/martin/www/pub/AlgorithmW.pdf">Algorithm W Step by Step</a>, for implementing the classic Algorithm W (proposed by Robin Milner) for type inference in Haskell. I was stoked to finally take a closer look at Hindley-Milner and foolishly thought I would spend a few days on it.</p>

<p>In reality, I had started my descent down the rabbit hole. I found myself reading, and while I felt comfortable with the actual Haskell code itself, the reasons for why the tutorial was implementing things by using sets, or talking about free type variables and type schemes made me feel that yeah, maybe(?) I could infer something from my understanding of Haskell, but I was still lacking appropriate knowledge for this literature.</p>

<p>So, I asked this silly question on Zulip:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Stream Subject</strong>: Category Theory/Type Theory/Set Theory</p>

<p><strong>Message</strong>: Hi hi. I&rsquo;m delving into Hindley-Milner for type inference and I&rsquo;m finding lots of terminology that I don&rsquo;t understand. Are there any friendly introductions to all of the theories? AM I WAY IN OVER MY HEAD?</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.rntz.net/">Rntz</a> pointed me to <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/">Types and Programming Languages</a> as a resource and I was intrigued. I started reading it, and of course my attention started to wane because textbooks. After some googling, and remembering back to my first week at Hacker School, I was reminded of a UPenn grad course called <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/current/index.html">Software Foundations</a>. The course uses TAPL but also utilizes an interactive book of Coq proofs as its main text. Interactive? Sign me up.</p>

<p>Two ways to run Coq are through the CoqIDE or through Proof General Coq mode in Emacs. I found to my chagrin that CoqIDE was ugly and slow and in general, not something that I wanted to use. But that meant that I had to learn&hellip; Emacs. So for about two hours, I went through the Emacs tutorial and fiddled with my .emacs file, thinking about the time I saw Richard Stallman dressed as a saint from the Church of Emacs and resigned myself to learning a new text editor/operating system/whatever (plz don&rsquo;t hurt me, I&rsquo;m new to emacs).</p>

<p>After this, I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to run Coq through Proof General, and time passed while I grew increasingly frustrated. Then Alan to the rescue! He helped me figure out that emacs wasn&rsquo;t correctly loading my path, and once that was fixed, I was able to write Coq and do cute stuff like:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Yay!</p>

<p>Tomorrow I will continue working through Software Foundations. Aki, an alum, has also kindly pointed me to some resources for implementing type inference algorithms which I plan to hit up once I have gotten a feel for the theory behind it. Excited to see where this leads.</p>

<p>Oh, and I remapped <code>Caps Lock</code> from <code>ESC</code> to <code>CTRL</code>. So, uh, yeah.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday was a super productive day for me. In the morning, I was in the midst of debugging my gunzip implementation in Haskell.
I have a function <code>addItem</code> that adds a node to a HuffmanTree by writing an IORef val because I needed mutability. When I&rsquo;m creating the HuffmanTree, I need to add a whole slew of values (from a code table) into the tree, so I mapped the addItem function over the list of codes, which returned <code>[IO()]</code>. My problem here was that despite having added items to an initial empty tree, I was returning an unaltered tree. I was confused because I was sure I had allowed for mutability! But why?!</p>

<p>Luckily, Alan happened to be running an impromptu session on Monads where he covered the IO Monad, and attending that helped me figure out what my problem was, I think.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still not precisely sure if I&rsquo;m understanding correctly but <code>[IO()]</code> is a list of <code>IO()</code>s. And things in the IO monad won&rsquo;t evaluate until run-time. So basically I had a list of thunk-like things that wouldn&rsquo;t write until evaluated.</p>

<p>This does not work</p>

<p>but this works</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As an aside, <code>added</code> is actually a useless value (it&rsquo;s just a list of <code>()</code>s). I don&rsquo;t care about it. All I care about is the value of <code>root</code> because I have mutated it to add nodes to it.</p>

<p>After this, I spent some time fixing off by one errors because I was translating Julia code to Haskell and Julia is 1-indexed while Haskell is 0-index. Lol. THEN IT WORKED. HUZZAH!</p>

<p>In the afternoon into the evening, I worked with Dana, Minnie, and Sophia on soldering chips, wires, and LEDs together. It was loads of fun and will continue today, I suspect.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wow, wow, wow. This week marked the halfway point of my time at Hacker School. It&rsquo;s been an exciting time, with the incoming of the new batch (28 new Hacker Schoolers!) and 455 Broadway is much more lively than it was before. It&rsquo;s been harder to find a place to sit, which is a good problem to have. :)</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t blogged since last week, so a lot has happened since then:</p>

<ul>
<li>Very proud to say that I made the <code>cats</code> stream on Zulip.</li>
<li>My implementation of gunzip is undergoing debugging, so hopefully I can have that done by the end of the week.</li>
<li>Dana taught me how to solder! I soldered wires onto a strip of NeoPixels.</li>
<li>Dana and I checked out <a href="https://hackmanhattan.com/">HackManhattan</a>, a space for hardware hackers. They were kind enough to let us go through their extra parts and we found the power sources we were looking for for the party on Friday.</li>
<li>Mel Chua, our first resident, gave us very informative talks on different learning styles and how to maximize our time at Hacker School. I do sort of wish this happend on the first week for &ldquo;seconds&rdquo; since I feel like some of us floundered at figuring out how to get used to self-directedness.</li>
<li>I missed my first Friday session to go visit my mom in North Carolina.</li>
<li>I am back to being addicted to coffee. <a href="http://www.portorico.com/store/">Porto Rico Importing Co.</a> is my vice.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&rsquo;s to another six weeks! Well, more like 5 and a half weeks. :D:D:D:D:D:D: &lt;&mdash; Some alums taught me this happy/sad combo face.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For a couple of days, I told myself that I would study OCaml now that I have a decent grasp of Haskell. But it&rsquo;s actually been pretty
difficult to leave Haskell because I am rather enamoured with the language. &#10084;</p>

<p>I did however, manage to read through a good chunk of <a href="http://ocaml-book.com/">OCaml from the Very Beginning</a>, and work through the exercises that accompany each chapter. I found it to be a very solid introductory text, as the author makes no assumptions about the reader&rsquo;s background. I plan to finish it up at some point, and move on to <em>Real World OCaml</em>.</p>

<p>A couple of things that jumped out at me as I started learning OCaml:</p>

<ul>
<li>The standard library is pretty sparse. Will be checking out Jane Street&rsquo;s Core.</li>
<li>There are mutable data structures.</li>
<li>OCaml supports imperative and functional styles.</li>
<li>The introductory text, at least <em>OCaml from the Very Beginning</em>, emphasized understanding tail recursion (which I didn&rsquo;t really think about when learning Haskell, but maybe I did it wrong)</li>
<li>Utop is pretty cool.</li>
<li>I got confused by <code>=</code> and <code>==</code> because I wanted to use <code>==</code> but that seems to be reserved for people who really know what they&rsquo;re doing.</li>

<p>For the past few days, I have been exploring file compression and decompression. I needed a new project and starting looking at what previous HSers had done, and I found this <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/10/24/day-16-gzip-plus-poetry-equals-awesome/">blog post</a> by alumna <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk">Julia Evans</a> on implementing gunzip in Julia. So I&rsquo;ve decided to implement it in Haskell! :D :D :D</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading up on the <a href="http://www.gzip.org/algorithm.txt">algorithm specifications</a> for inflating and deflating and the <a href="http://www.gzip.org/format.txt">format</a> information. I tried looking at the source in C but my head started to hurt, so I have been studying Julia&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/jvns/gzip.jl/blob/master/gzip.jl">implementation</a>, which despite me never having seen Julia code before, has been very helpful.</p>

<p>I spent today working on parsing a gzipped file&rsquo;s header and metadata information. Tomorrow I will read up more on the algorithm description and dive into implementing inflate.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday at Hacker School was Recursion Friday. Basically, a group of HSers sat down and worked on various recursive problems and brain teasers in the languages of our choice.</p>

<p>Recursion used to make me go like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.giphy.com/media/NoglyWTK9tCMw/giphy.gif" alt="Scared" /></p>

<p>But somewhere along the way as I was learning Haskell, recursion started to click with my previously recursion-addled brain.</p>

<p>One of the questions yesterday was to find all of the permutations of a string. After some white boarding with Denise and Georgi, talking it through with Alan and Tom, we basically came to the conclusion that the algorithm should be something like this (in pseudocode):</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Permute("abcd") =
</span><span class='line'>    "a" + Permute("bcd") 
</span><span class='line'>    &lt;list concatenation&gt; 
</span><span class='line'>    "b" + Permute("acd") 
</span><span class='line'>    &lt;list concatenation&gt;
</span><span class='line'>    "c" + Permute("bcd") 
</span><span class='line'>    &lt;list concatenation&gt;
</span><span class='line'>    "d" + Permute("abc") </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So, generate all of the permutations of the string without one of the elements of the original string, and concat it with all possible permutations of the smaller string, then concat all of those together to get the final list of permutations.</p>

<p>After speaking with Alan about a Haskell implementation, this is what I ended up with</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="kr">import</span> <span class="nn">Data.List</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nf">permute</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">Eq</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="ow">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="ow">-&gt;</span> <span class="p">[[</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">]]</span>

</span><span class='line'>                   <span class="o">$</span> <span class="n">permute</span> <span class="o">$</span> <span class="n">xs</span> <span class="o">\\</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">prefix</span><span class="p">]]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>An obnoxiously short list comprehension.</p>

<p>Pull the prefix from the original string, map a list concatenation of the prefix, (prefix:), to the various permutations of the rest of the string. <code>\\</code> is this nifty function in the Data.List library that performs list difference, so it was an easy way to exclude the prefix from the original string (thanks to Alan for showing me that).</p>
